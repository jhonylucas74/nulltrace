# No real brands

Do not use real brand names, trademarks, or references to real companies in any text, UI copy, or in-game content.

- **Forbidden examples:** GitHub, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Twitter/X, Instagram, Netflix, Spotify, and any other real-world brand or product name.
- **Apply to:** User-facing strings, placeholder content, demo pages, mock data, error messages, tooltips, and any narrative or in-game text.
- **Use instead:** Generic terms (e.g. "search engine", "code host", "social app"), fictional names, or placeholders (e.g. "Example Corp", "search.example") so the project stays brand-neutral.

This rule must be followed in all code and content produced for this project.
